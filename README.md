I used Livebook, since it provides excelent development UX for tasks like this.

## Install

We need the newest Livebook, because of some features used in this repository.


`mix escript.install github livebook-dev/livebook`

Run `livebook server`

Open the URL returned from previous command

## Inputs

Inputs are in the `inputs` directory for convenience.
